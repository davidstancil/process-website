					<p>What is the problem you are trying to solve?
						The problem I would like to solve is providing additional insight to the websites overall design so that it will be more effective at providing information to prospective donors and beneficiaries alike.
					</p>
					<p>State the ultimate impact you want to have.
						To aid the non-profit organization in achieving their overall goal of providing affordable housing to the homeless and underprivileged.
					</p>
					<p>What are some possible solutions to your problem?
Changing the website so that it will be more effective at communicating its message. Sitting down with the executive director to learn of some other issues they may be having.
</p>
					<p>Possible constraints.
Possibly not being able to sit down with the executive director to discover additional problems. They are located in Greenville, so I anticipate meeting with Mrs. Crowl face to face. If I am unable to reach her, then I will reach out to others coles to her position. I am also hoping that they will have some test users who can give feedback on their current website.
</p>
<p>Rephrase initial problem question.
building the website so it is optimized for all browsers and devices, utilizing photos of success stories that are not from stock photo websites, breaking up information so that it can breathe in white space, and making user navigation seamless by making sure crucial information is simple to locate. This will be used in secondary research
