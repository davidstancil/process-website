	<h1>United Housing Connections</h1>
	<p class="info">Client Description</p>
</header>
<p> The client in a non profit operating out of Upstate South Carolina by providing affordable housing for homeless, disabled, or low income/ at risk of being homeless individuals. This is a fairly large organization that has many employees and many successful placements of the prior individuals in affordable housing. The main visitors of the website include people wishing to donate money, volunteer time, or receive affordable housing. Donors and volunteers are always welcomed as a resource, but individuals wanting to benefit from the affordable housing must qualify by contacting United Housing Connections. Overall, the annual reports show that this non profit is losing money faster than it can generate it, but so long as they prove in those reports that the money from government grants and donors is being used to provide housing, then I donâ€™t particularly have an issue with this non profit from a business standpoint.</p>

						<h1>The Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">List of Design Challenge Questions</p>
					</header>
					<h2>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</h2>
						<p>The problem I would like to solve is providing additional insight to the websites overall design so that it will be more effective at providing information to prospective donors and beneficiaries alike.
					</p>
					<h2>State the ultimate impact you want to have.</h2>
						<p>To aid the non-profit organization in achieving their overall goal of providing affordable housing to the homeless and underprivileged.
					</p>
					<h2>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h2>
<p>Changing the website so that it will be more effective at communicating its message. Sitting down with the executive director to learn of some other issues they may be having.
</p>
					<h2>Possible constraints.</h2>
<p>Possibly not being able to sit down with the executive director to discover additional problems. They are located in Greenville, so I anticipate meeting with Mrs. Crowl face to face. If I am unable to reach her, then I will reach out to others coles to her position. I am also hoping that they will have some test users who can give feedback on their current website.
</p>
<h2>Rephrase initial problem question.</h2>
<p>Building the website so it is optimized for all browsers and devices, utilizing photos of success stories that are not from stock photo websites, breaking up information so that it can breathe in white space, and making user navigation seamless by making sure crucial information is simple to locate. This will be used in secondary research</p>
