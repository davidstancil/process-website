						<h2>Recent news in the clients field from a internet article.</h2>
						<p>The most recent news in my clients field pertains to the current
 situation of homeless people in the Upstate South Carolina. It states that there are 3,502 homeless people in the upstate. Overall, this article add very useful insight to the homeless situation in the Upstate of South Carolina.</p>

						<h2>Recent cultural innovations in clients field.</h2>
						<p>The cultural innovation that happened for my client was that there is new legislature that forces for affordable homes to be up to sanitation standards. In the past, home would deteriorate and accumulate unaddressed health risks, which posed threats to the individuals
 living in those homes. This legislation will require more in-depth photography so that appraisers can access the condition of the home.

						<h2>Recent cultural innovations in clients field.</h2>
						<p>Here
 I chose the competitor of United Housing Connections which is Homes of Hope, who is also grant funded and facilitates cheaper homes for the homeless. The Homes of Hope Website was much easier to navigate, had a better sense of design, and overall had less
 issues than United Housing Connections. Their 2018 annual reports had beautiful typeface pairings and effective overall design continuity.</p>

					<h2>Market data compared aginst a main competitor.</h2>
					<p>The
 market data I found is in both websites 2018 annual reports. I listed several screenshots comparing the pages of the reports, and there are many major differences conceding content layout and design choices. The data of United Housing Connections said that
 they had had a net loss of $355, 259. Homes of Hopes net income $2,060,706. Needless to say, Homes of Hope is excelling financially while United Housing Connections is suffering a loss. To solve the design problem, I believe that it will be very important
 for United Housing Connections to learn from Homes of Hope not just on the basis of their website design, but also in how they conduct business.

									<h1>Interviews</h1>
									<p class="info">Information from the Interviews</p>
								</header>
								<p>Below is the email I sent the executive director, Lorin Crowl of United Housing Connections. She was not able to meet with me in person or connect me to anyone else within her organization other than herself, so I had to settle with an email interview. Initially, she said that she would connect me with Michelle, the marketing coordinator within her organization who is responsible for website changes, but sadly Mrs. Crowl did not follow through in this regard. Since she is the executive director, I did appreciate her response to my questions and learned some valuable insight into who uses their site and what some demographics are. My results are below, her responses are underlined.

David,
These were relatively easy to answer. Here you go (see in blue below).
Thanks,
Lorain
Good afternoon Mrs. Crowl,


Here is the list of questions that I have for Michelle:


1.Who is the main demographic of your beneficiaries (age,sex,race,ect)?

We reach a broad spectrum of people, but generally our clients are 55% black 45% White
The majority of the people on our priority list are single, homeless males followed by single-parent homeless families or at-risk for homelessness
Most are between the ages of 35 and 55


2. Who is the main demographic of your donors and volunteers
(age,sex,race,ect)?

Age range: 25-65, more women donate than men. More women volunteer than men.


3.How do you meet the qualifications to get government sponsored grants?

UHC is the lead agency for the Upstate Continuum of Care. We are HUD approved and appointed by the local CoC Advisory Board to be the collaborative applicant for federal funding.
To learn more, visit the website www.upstatecoc.org

4.Who are your main competitors and what do they do differently from you?

We are the only organization whose main mission is to provide permanent supportive housing in the Upstate (that is housing with case management and support services to help individuals and families get on their feet)


5. What is the first thing you want people to do when they go to your website?

 Find out about our programs. Call the resource line if they need housing.

6. Do you have more donors, beneficiaries, or volunteers visiting your website?

Most visitors are people who need housing and services


7. How do you reassure donors that their money is being put to good use?

We provide an annual 990,  annual audited financials, and an annual report to show how funds were utilized.


8. How do the employees feel about the usability of the website?

We have not heard complaints.


9. Do you ever get complaints about difficulties finding information on the website from your users?
No

10. Do you connect with other nonprofits to collaborate on events?
Yes



I called Mrs. Crowl after she emailed me her response to find if there are any beneficiaries, donors, or volunteers I could speak with for the website user interview. She connected me with Mrs. James who is a frequent volunteer of United Housing Connections. She frequently volunteers because her brother was homeless for several years in the Upstate and found affordable housing with the organization, and she enjoys helping people get out of the situation that her brother was in not that long ago. I was able to speak with Mrs. James over the phone on October the 14th to ask her questions about how useful the United Housing Connections website is volunteers and if she has ever had difficulty finding events to attend or learning about the volunteering process. Mrs. James told me that she knows that the website isn’t perfect, and there are some glaring issues on the home page where otherwise valuable information would be. She told me that she has helped volunteer at planned meal partnerships, beautification projects, and donation drives and had no issues finding that information on the homepage once she found it the first time. But she did tell me that she would appreciate it if she did not have to scroll to the bottom of the page every time she needed to see the events calendar. Also, to get more information on those events, she has to contact Suzanne Eskew on the volunteer page to get more information and would find it helpful if there was a calendar she could click on. Overall, the phone conversation I had with Mrs. James was very pleasant and helped me find some website user insight even though I would have enjoyed talking to the website and marketing coordinator for United Housing Connections.
