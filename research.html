						<sub>Recent news in the clients field from a internet article.</sub>
						<p>The most recent news in my clients field pertains to the current
 situation of homeless people in the Upstate South Carolina. It states that there are 3,502 homeless people in the upstate. Overall, this article add very useful insight to the homeless situation in the Upstate of South Carolina.</p>

						<sub>Recent cultural innovations in clients field.</sub>
						<p>The
 cultural innovation that happened for my client was that there is new legislature that forces for affordable homes to be up to sanitation standards. In the past, home would deteriorate and accumulate unaddressed health risks, which posed threats to the individuals
 living in those homes. This legislation will require more in-depth photography so that appraisers can access the condition of the home.

			<div>
						<sub>Recent cultural innovations in clients field.</sub>
						<p>Here
 I chose the competitor of United Housing Connections which is Homes of Hope, who is also grant funded and facilitates cheaper homes for the homeless. The Homes of Hope Website was much easier to navigate, had a better sense of design, and overall had less
 issues than United Housing Connections. Their 2018 annual reports had beautiful typeface pairings and effective overall design continuity.</p>

					<sub>Market data compared aginst a main competitor.</sub>
					<p>The
 market data I found is in both websites 2018 annual reports. I listed several screenshots comparing the pages of the reports, and there are many major differences conceding content layout and design choices. The data of United Housing Connections said that
 they had had a net loss of $355, 259. Homes of Hopes net income $2,060,706. Needless to say, Homes of Hope is excelling financially while United Housing Connections is suffering a loss. To solve the design problem, I believe that it will be very important
 for United Housing Connections to learn from Homes of Hope not just on the basis of their website design, but also in how they conduct business.
